Question:[35m
Identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', whose name does not correspond with their description. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m

```
DataRetrieval: The name suggests data retrieval, but the description states it saves the results of the experiment and produces plots.
ModelTraining: The name implies model training, but the description specifies it trains a regression ML model, which might not be accurate if the task can be used for classification as well.

Identify tasks in workflow 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' (including all nested subtasks), whose description does not correspond with the description of the workflow. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
DataRetrieval: The task is about saving results and producing plots, which is not directly related to binary classification.
ModelTraining: The task description mentions "trains the regression ML model," which is not aligned with the binary classification objective.
ModelEvaluation: The task description mentions "evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics," which is not aligned with the binary classification objective.[0m
