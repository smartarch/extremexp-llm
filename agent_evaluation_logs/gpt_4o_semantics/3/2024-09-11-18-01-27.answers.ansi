Pattern: [33mInconsistent task name and description[0m
Question:[35m
Identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', whose name does not correspond with their description. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
DataRetrieval: The description does not align with the name, as it mentions saving results and producing plots, not retrieving data.
ModelTraining: The description mentions training a regression ML model, which does not match the binary classification context.
ModelEvaluation: The description evaluates a regression model, which is inconsistent with the binary classification goal of the workflow.[0m
