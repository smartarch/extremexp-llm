responded: To identify tasks in the 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow whose names do not correspond with their descriptions, we need to first obtain the specification of the workflow. This specification will include the tasks and their descriptions. Once we have this information, we can analyze each task to determine if the name accurately reflects its description.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Obtain the specification of the 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow.
2. Review each task within the workflow, comparing the name of the task to its description.
3. Identify any discrepancies where the task name does not align with the task's description.

Let's begin by obtaining the specification of the 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow.

From this analysis, it is clear that the task **DataRetrieval** has a name that does not correspond well with its description. The other tasks have names that accurately reflect their descriptions.

### HyperparameterOptimization Subworkflow:
1. **HyperparameterProposal**: Repeatedly proposes hyperparameter configurations until a stop condition is met (based on the metrics of the current ML model).
2. **MLModelValidation**: Trains and evaluates the ML model with the proposed hyperparameter configuration.
3. **BestHyperparameterSelection**: Asks the user to select the best hyperparameter configuration.

### MLTrainingAndEvaluation Subworkflow:
1. **FeatureExtraction**: Extracts features from the input data.
2. **ModelTraining**: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters.
3. **ModelEvaluation**: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics.

### Main Workflow: FailurePredictionInManufacture
1. **DataRetrieval**: Saves the results of the experiment and produces plots.
2. **TrainTestSplit**: Randomly splits the data into training and test sets.
3. **HyperparameterOptimization**: (subworkflow) Uses grid search to explore hyperparameter configurations and asks the user to select the best one.
    - **HyperparameterProposal**: Repeatedly proposes hyperparameter configurations until a stop condition is met (based on the metrics of the current ML model).
    - **MLModelValidation**: Trains and evaluates the ML model with the proposed hyperparameter configuration.
    - **BestHyperparameterSelection**: Asks the user to select the best hyperparameter configuration.
4. **MLTrainingAndEvaluation**: (subworkflow) Final training and evaluation of the ML model with the best hyperparameters.
    - **FeatureExtraction**: Extracts features from the input data.
    - **ModelTraining**: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters.
    - **ModelEvaluation**: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics.

Now, we need to identify the tasks whose descriptions do not correspond with the description of the main workflow 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', which is "AutoML for selecting a model to perform prediction of machine failures (binary classification)."

Let's analyze each task's description against this main workflow description:

1. **DataRetrieval**: Description does not mention activities related to "AutoML for selecting a model to perform prediction of machine failures". It mentions saving results and producing plots, which seems unrelated.
2. **TrainTestSplit**: Description aligns with the main workflow as splitting data is a fundamental step in model training.
3. **HyperparameterOptimization**:
    - **HyperparameterProposal**: Aligns with the main workflow as it deals with proposing hyperparameters for model selection.
    - **MLModelValidation**: Aligns with the main workflow as it involves training and evaluating the model.
    - **BestHyperparameterSelection**: Aligns with the main workflow as it's related to selecting the best hyperparameters for the model.
4. **MLTrainingAndEvaluation**:
    - **FeatureExtraction**: Description does not mention binary classification and is more generic.
    - **ModelTraining**: Mentions training a regression model, which is not aligned with binary classification.
    - **ModelEvaluation**: Mentions regression metrics, which do not correspond with binary classification.

### Final answer:
DataRetrieval: The task description does not mention activities related to AutoML for predicting machine failures.
FeatureExtraction: The task description does not mention binary classification and is more generic.
