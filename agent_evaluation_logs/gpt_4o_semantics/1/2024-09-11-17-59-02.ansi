Each of the tasks can be composed of a subworkflow and you can use tools to obtain the specification of the subworkflow.\n\nThe workflow is specified using a DSL:\narrows "->" represent control flow\narrows with question mark “?->” represent conditional control flow\ndashed arrows "-->" represent data flow\n\nA workflow can be derived from another workflow, which is denoted by the "from" keyword. When working with a derived workflow, always obtain the specification of the base workflow as it is necessary to fully understand the derived workflow.\n\nThink in steps and use the available tools. Use the tools if you need specification of a workflow or a task, list the results collected during the experiment, etc. If the information cannot be obtained using the tools, ask the user. Always gather all the necessary information before submitting your final answer.\n')

responded: To identify tasks in the `automl_ideko.FailurePredictionInManufacture` workflow whose names do not correspond with their descriptions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain the full specification of the `FailurePredictionInManufacture` workflow.
2. Review each task's name and description to determine if they align.
3. Cross-check any subworkflows or derived workflows to ensure completeness.
4. List any tasks where the names and descriptions do not correspond.
