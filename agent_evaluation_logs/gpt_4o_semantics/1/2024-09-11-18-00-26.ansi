1. Obtain the specification of the 'automl_ideko.FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow.
2. Identify all tasks within the workflow and their descriptions.
3. Compare each task's name with its description to determine if there are any discrepancies.

### Workflow Analysis

1. **FailurePredictionInManufacture** (automl_ideko)
   - **Description**: AutoML for selecting a model to perform prediction of machine failures (binary classification).
   
   #### Tasks:
   - **DataRetrieval**
     - **Description**: Saves the results of the experiment and produces plots.
   - **HyperparameterOptimization**
     - **Description**: Uses grid search to explore hyperparameter configurations and asks the user to select the best one.
     - **Subtasks**:
       - **HyperparameterProposal**
         - **Description**: Repeatedly proposes hyperparameter configurations until a stop condition is met (based on the metrics of the current ML model).
       - **MLModelValidation**
         - **Description**: Trains and evaluates the ML model with the proposed hyperparameter configuration.
         - **Subtask**:
           - **MLTrainingAndEvaluation** (subworkflow)
             - **Description**: Training and evaluation of the ML model with the given hyperparameters.
   - **MLTrainingAndEvaluation** (subworkflow)
     - **Description**: Final training and evaluation of the ML model with the best hyperparameters.
       - **Subtasks**:
         - **FeatureExtraction**
           - **Description**: Extracts features from the input data.
         - **ModelTraining**
           - **Description**: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters.
         - **ModelEvaluation**
           - **Description**: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics.

### Identifying Discrepancies

To identify discrepancies, I'll compare each task description against the overall description of the workflow.

- **DataRetrieval**: Description does not mention data retrieval but instead mentions saving results and producing plots. This seems unrelated to the main goal of predicting machine failures.
- **ModelTraining**: The description mentions training a regression ML model, which contradicts the main goal of binary classification for predicting machine failures.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the tasks whose descriptions do not align with the workflow description are:

Final answer:
DataRetrieval: The task focuses on saving results and producing plots, which is unrelated to the failure prediction goal.
ModelTraining: The task description mentions training a regression model, whereas the workflow is intended for binary classification.[0m
