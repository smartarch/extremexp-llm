responded: To identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' whose name does not correspond with their description, I will first need to obtain the full specification of the workflow. This will give me an overview of all the tasks involved, their names, and their descriptions. After reviewing the specification, I can determine which tasks have names that do not align with their descriptions.

Here are the steps I will follow:

1. Obtain the specification of the 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow.
2. Review the specification to extract the names and descriptions of each task.
3. Identify tasks where the name does not match the description.

I will start by fetching the workflow specification using the appropriate tool.

2. **MLModelValidation**: Trains and evaluates the ML model with the proposed hyperparameter configuration.

### Subworkflow 'MLTrainingAndEvaluation'

2. **ModelTraining**: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters.
3. **ModelEvaluation**: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics.

**Tasks that do not correspond with the workflow description:**
- **ModelTraining**: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters.
- **ModelEvaluation**: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics.

These tasks are focused on regression rather than binary classification.
