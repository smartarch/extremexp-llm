Pattern: [33mInconsistent task name and description[0m
Question:[35m
Identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', whose name does not correspond with their description. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m

```
DataRetrieval: The name suggests it should retrieve data, not save results or produce plots.
ModelTraining: The description indicates training a regression model, but the overall workflow is for binary classification.
ModelEvaluation: The description indicates evaluation using regression metrics, but the overall workflow is for binary classification.

Identify tasks in workflow 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' (including all nested subtasks), whose description does not correspond with the description of the workflow. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question.

Answer:[36m
DataRetrieval: The description suggests it is focused on saving results and plotting, which is not central to the workflow's main objective.
ModelTraining: The focus on regression is not aligned with the binary classification objective of the main workflow.
ModelEvaluation: Using regression metrics is misaligned with the binary classification goal.[0m
