Pattern: [33mInconsistent task name and description[0m
Question:[35m
Identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', whose name does not correspond with their description. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
- DataRetrieval: The description suggests it is for saving results and producing plots, which does not align with the task's name.
- ModelTraining: Described as training a regression model, which conflicts with the workflow's aim of binary classification for failure prediction.[0m

- DataRetrieval: Its description suggests it is for post-experiment analysis, not for retrieving data.
- ModelTraining: It mentions training a regression model, which contradicts the binary classification objective.
- ModelEvaluation: It talks about using regression metrics for evaluation, which is not suitable for a binary classification task.[0m
