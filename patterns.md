# Test instance patterns

This is a full list of test instance *patterns* that can be used for evaluating understanding workflow architectures by LLMs.

To create *test instances* from the patterns, substitute all the parameters. Note that it might also be necessary to alter the question formulations to adapt them to the language of the specific workflow architecture.

## Structure patterns

### List of tasks

Rationale: Can the LLM list the tasks in a workflow and filter them?

Parameters:

* $P$: property of the tasks (e.g., the task has a parameter), can be empty (to list all the tasks)
* $N$: number of tasks satisfying $P$
* $T$: total number of tasks
* $W$: workflow name

Architecture: Workflow $W$ with $N$ tasks satisfying $P$ and $T-N$ tasks not satisfying $P$.

Question: List all tasks in workflow $W$ that satisfy $P$.

Reference answer: *a set of $N$ tasks satisfying $P$ (depends on the parameter substitution for the test instance)*

Evaluation metric: Jaccard index

Example instance: "List all tasks in workflow 'MLTrainingAndEvaluation' that have a parameter."

## Behavior patterns

### Trace of tasks

Rationale: Can the LLM determine if a trace of tasks can occur?

* $R_1, \dots, R_L$ ($L \le K$): tasks that will run when the workflow is executed with initial situation $S$

Architecture: Workflow $W$ with tasks $T_1, \dots, T_K$. When $W$ is executed with initial situation $S$, tasks $R_1, \dots, R_L$ will run in this order.

Question: Can the trace of tasks $R_1, \dots, R_K$ occur in workflow $W$ in this order?

Reference answer: yes

Evaluation metric: correctness

Rationale: Can the LLM understand the order of tasks in the workflow with conditional flow?

Parameters:

* $W$: workflow name
* $T_1, \dots, T_K$: tasks in the workflow $W$
* $S$: situation (e.g., parameter values)
* $R_1, \dots, R_L$ ($L \le K$): tasks that will run when the workflow is executed with initial situation $S$

Architecture: Workflow $W$ with tasks $T_1, \dots, T_K$. When $W$ is executed with initial situation $S$, tasks $R_1, \dots, R_L$ will run in this order.

Question: Given the initial situation $S$, list all the tasks that will run when workflow $W$ is executed in order in which they will run.

Reference answer: $R_1, \dots, R_L$ *(note: if some tasks can run in parallel, they can be listed in any order)*

Evaluation metric: Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance *(note: special care must be given to the order of parallel tasks)*

Example instance: "Given the initial situation p=0, list all the tasks that will run when workflow 'Workflow3' is executed in order in which they will run.", reference answer: Task7, Task8

---

## Semantics patterns

### Inconsistent descriptions

Rationale: Can the LLM detect inconsistent descriptions of workflow and tasks?

Parameters:

* $W$: workflow name
* $D_W$: workflow description
* $D_T$: task description that is inconsistent with $D_W$

Architecture: Workflow containing a task with inconsistent description.

Question: Identify potential errors in the specification of $W$ and present a list of them.

Reference answer: *description of the inconsistency (depends on the test instance)*

Evaluation metric: ROUGE

Example instance: A workflow specifying an ML pipeline where the ML goal is said to be "binary classification" in the workflow description. At the same time, the tasks perform training of a "regression" ML model (which is inconsistent with "binary classification").

---

### Semantically incorrect order of tasks

Rationale: Can the LLM detect tasks that are clearly in wrong order (semantically)?

Parameters:

* $W$: workflow name
* $T_1, T_2$: tasks in $W$
* $F$: flow type (e.g., control flow)

Architecture: Workflow $W$ containing tasks $T_1, T_2$ (and possibly other). In flow $F$, the link $T_1 \to T_2$ is semantically incorrect.

Question: Identify potential errors in the specification of $W$ and present a list of them.

Reference answer: Task $T_2$ should precede task $T_1$ in flow $F$. *(concrete formulation depends on the test instance)*

Evaluation metric: ROUGE

Example instance: Workflow with task 'MLModelTraining' after 'MLModelEvaluation'.

---

### Understanding properties (meaning) of tasks

Rationale: Can the LLM understand meaning of tasks (e.g., task performs an operation that is not directly mentioned in the name)?

Parameters:

* $W$: workflow name
* $P$: property of task (e.g., the task is part of data preprocessing)
* $T_1$: task in $W$ with property $P$
* $T_2$: task in $W$

Architecture: Workflow $W$ containing tasks $T_1, T_2$ (and possibly other). Property $P$ is mentioned in description/specification of $T_1$. Task $T_1$ precedes (not necessarily directly) task $T_2$ in the control flow.

Question: Does a task with property $P$ run before $T_2$?

Reference answer: yes

Evaluation metric: correctness

Example instance: Task 'FeatureExtraction' is labeled as "data preprocessing" and it precedes 'MLModelTraining', question: "Does a data preprocessing task run before 'MLModelTraining?"

Note: Other variants of this pattern can also be created, e.g., "Does a task with property $P$ run *after* $T_2$?" (if the order of tasks is appropriately changed in the architecture).

---

Rationale: Can the LLM understand meaning of tasks (e.g., task performs an operation that is not directly mentioned in the name)? (negative test)

Parameters:

* $W$: workflow name
* $P$: property of task (e.g., the task is part of data preprocessing)
* $T_2$: task in $W$

Architecture: Workflow $W$ containing task $T_2$ (and possibly other). No tasks preceding $T_2$ in the control flow satisfy the property $P$.

Question: Does a task with property $P$ run before $T_2$?

Reference answer: no

Evaluation metric: correctness

Example instance: "Does a data preprocessing task run before 'DataRetrieval?" (some of the later tasks might be labeled as "data preprocessing")

Note: Other variants of this pattern can also be created, e.g., "Does a task with property $P$ run *after* $T_2$?" (if the order of tasks is appropriately changed in the architecture).

## Evaluation metrics used in the patterns

### Yes-no questions, questions with one correct answer

* **correctness**: $1$ if LLM's answer = reference answer, $0$ otherwise

### Set questions

* **Jaccard index**: the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets (LLM's answer set and the reference answer set)

### List (ordered) questions

* **Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance**: edit distance between two sequences allowing insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transposition (swap) of two adjacent elements

### Open questions (semantics)

* [**ROUGE**](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/) (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): the word overlap of the reference answer and the LLM output
* [**BERTScore**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675): the cosine similarity of word embeddings (that capture the meaning of words)
* **manual**: manual assessment of the LLM's output
* **LLM as a judge** (e.g., [G-Eval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634)): use another LLM to assess the LLM's output
