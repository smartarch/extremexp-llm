The current implementation uses grid search to try all the hyperparameter configurations. Suggest alternative implementations that could improve the results and run time of the experiment. Before suggesting the alternatives, explore the whole specification of the workflow including the relevant sub-workflows to make sure that your suggested alternatives are valid and can be easily implemented in this experiment.
