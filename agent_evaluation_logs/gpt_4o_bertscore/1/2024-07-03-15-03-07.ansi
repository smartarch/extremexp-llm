When working with a derived workflow, always obtain the specification of the base workflow as it is necessary to fully understand the derived workflow.\n\nThink in steps and use the available tools. Use the tools if you need specification of a workflow or a task, list the results collected during the experiment, etc. If the information cannot be obtained using the tools, ask the user. Always gather all the necessary information before submitting your final answer.\n')

1. FeatureExtraction
2. ModelTraining
3. ModelEvaluation

Given the primary goal of 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' is binary classification for predicting machine failures, we need to ensure that each task aligns with this purpose. Here’s a detailed look:

1. **FeatureExtraction**: Extracts features from the input data. This is necessary for any ML workflow and aligns with the overall goal.
2. **ModelTraining**: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters. Regression models are not typically used for binary classification, which suggests a potential misalignment.
3. **ModelEvaluation**: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics. Metrics like regression metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) are useful for classification, but the mention of regression might imply non-binary classification, which could be misaligned.

Considering the goal of binary classification for predicting machine failures, the tasks related to regression might not correspond well with the workflow's description.

Final answer:
```
ModelTraining: Trains the regression ML model with the given hyperparameters, which does not align with the binary classification goal.
ModelEvaluation: Evaluates the trained ML model using regression metrics, which might not be suitable for binary classification.
