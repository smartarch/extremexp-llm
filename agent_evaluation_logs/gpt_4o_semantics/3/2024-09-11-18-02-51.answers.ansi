Question:[35m
Identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', whose name does not correspond with their description. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
DataRetrieval: The name suggests retrieving data, but the description indicates saving results and producing plots.
ModelTraining: The description specifies training a regression ML model, which may not align with the binary classification context.
ModelEvaluation: The description specifies using regression metrics, which may not align with the binary classification context.[0m

Identify tasks in workflow 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' (including all nested subtasks), whose description does not correspond with the description of the workflow. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
DataRetrieval: The task focuses on saving results and producing plots, which is not directly related to predicting machine failures.
ModelTraining: The task description mentions training a regression ML model, which is not aligned with the binary classification goal of the workflow.
ModelEvaluation: The task description mentions evaluating the trained ML model using regression metrics, which is not suitable for the binary classification objective.
