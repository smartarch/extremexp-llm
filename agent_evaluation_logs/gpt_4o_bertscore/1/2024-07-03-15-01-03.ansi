responded: To identify tasks in 'automl_ideko.FailurePredictionInManufacture' whose name does not correspond with their description, we need to understand the workflow's specification. This includes obtaining details about each task within the workflow and comparing the names of the tasks with their descriptions to spot any discrepancies. 

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Obtain the specification of the 'automl_ideko.FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow.
2. Identify if this workflow is derived from another workflow and obtain the base workflow's specification, if necessary.
3. Analyze each task's name and description within the workflow to identify any discrepancies.

Let's start by obtaining the specification of the 'automl_ideko.FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow.

I'll use the tool to get the specification.
