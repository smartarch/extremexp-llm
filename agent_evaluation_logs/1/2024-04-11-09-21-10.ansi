Each of the tasks can be composed of a subworkflow and you can use tools to obtain the specification of the subworkflow.\n\nThe workflow is specified using a DSL:\narrows "->" represent control flow\narrows with question mark “?->” represent conditional control flow\ndashed arrows "-->" represent data flow\n\nA workflow can be derived from another workflow, which is denoted by the "from" keyword. When working with a derived workflow, always obtain the specification of the base workflow as it is necessary to fully understand the derived workflow.\n\nThink in steps and use the available tools. Use the tools if you need specification of a workflow or a task, list the results collected during the experiment, etc. If the information cannot be obtained using the tools, ask the user. Always gather all the necessary information before submitting your final answer.\n')

The control flow in `package1.Workflow1` consists of a series of tasks with a parallel branch (from `Task2` to `Task1` and `Task3` to `Task4`, which then converge) and then progresses linearly to the end. There are no back edges that would create a cycle in the control flow.[0m

This mutual exclusivity ensures that only one of these paths is taken after "HyperparameterProposal".[0m
