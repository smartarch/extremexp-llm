Each of the tasks can be composed of a subworkflow and you can use tools to obtain the description of the subworkflow.\n\nThe workflow is specified using a DSL:\narrows "->" represent control flow\narrows with question mark “?->” represent conditional control flow\ndashed arrows "-->" represent data flow\n\nThink in steps and use the available tools. Use the tools if you need description of a workflow or a task, list the results collected during the experiment, etc. If the information cannot be obtained using the tools, ask the user. Always gather all the necessary information before submitting your final answer.\n')

workflow_specification: Get the specification of the workflow (or subworkflow). Note that the workflow specification can contain references to subworkflows. To fully understand the whole workflow, it might be necessary to also obtain the specification of the subworkflows.

In workflow 'SubWorkflow', does 'Task9' follow directly after 'Task10' in the control flow? On the first line of your response, write either "yes" or "no" and nothing else. On the second, write a short justification of the answer.
