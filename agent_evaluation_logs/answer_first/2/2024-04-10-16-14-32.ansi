This loop allows for multiple iterations of proposing hyperparameters, validating them, and then using the validation results to propose new hyperparameters until a stopping condition is met.[0m

The conditional links from 'HyperparameterProposal' are mutually exclusive because one leads to 'BestHyperparameterSelection' under a specific stop condition, while the other leads to 'MLModelValidation' under an "otherwise" condition, implying that only one of the paths can be taken based on the evaluation of the stop condition.[0m
