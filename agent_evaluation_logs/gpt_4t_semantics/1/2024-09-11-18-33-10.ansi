SystemMessage(content='Your goal is to help the user with analyzing results of an experiment and suggest improvements to the experiment itself.\n\nThe experiment is defined by a workflow, which is an activity diagram consisting of several tasks with a data flow among them. Each of the tasks can be composed of a subworkflow and you can use tools to obtain the specification of the subworkflow.\n\nThe workflow is specified using a DSL:\narrows "->" represent control flow\narrows with question mark “?->” represent conditional control flow\ndashed arrows "-->" represent data flow\n\nA workflow can be derived from another workflow, which is denoted by the "from" keyword. When working with a derived workflow, always obtain the specification of the base workflow as it is necessary to fully understand the derived workflow.\n\nThink in steps and use the available tools. Use the tools if you need specification of a workflow or a task, list the results collected during the experiment, etc. If the information cannot be obtained using the tools, ask the user. Always gather all the necessary information before submitting your final answer.\n')

[0m[32;1m[1;3mThe task names should ideally reflect the actions or objectives they are designed to achieve within the workflow. By evaluating the task names against their descriptions in the 'automl_ideko.FailurePredictionInManufacture' workflow, we can identify discrepancies where a task's name may not accurately represent its described function. For example, a task named "DataRetrieval" should ideally involve fetching or retrieving data, but if its description suggests a different activity, such as data processing or model evaluation, then the name does not correspond well with its description.

Final answer:
- DataRetrieval: The description suggests it saves experiment results and produces plots, which does not align with typical data retrieval activities.
- HyperparameterOptimization: Its description mentions the use of grid search for exploring hyperparameters and involves user selection, which is more specific than the broad term "optimization".[0m

- **HyperparameterProposal**: Properly described as it fits into the hyperparameter optimization process.
- **MLModelValidation**, **MLTrainingAndEvaluation** (subworkflow task), and **BestHyperparameterSelection**: These descriptions align with the workflow's objectives, focusing on model validation, training, evaluation, and selection based on hyperparameters.
