Question:[35m
Identify tasks in 'FailurePredictionInManufacture', whose name does not correspond with their description. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
- DataRetrieval: Its description suggests it is responsible for saving results and plotting, not retrieving data.
- ModelTraining (under MLTrainingAndEvaluation): The description inaccurately describes the model type as regression in a binary classification task.
- ModelTraining (under HyperparameterOptimization > MLModelValidation > MLTrainingAndEvaluation): Similarly, describes training a regression model instead of a binary classification model.[0m

Question:[35m
Identify tasks in workflow 'FailurePredictionInManufacture' (including all nested subtasks), whose description does not correspond with the description of the workflow. Think step by step. First, reason about the question and write a short explanation of your answer. Then, on a separate line, write "Final answer:" followed by your final answer to the question. Your final answer must be a list of tasks. Write one task per line. Each line must start with the name of the task, followed by a colon (":"), and then one sentence describing why the task is included.[0m
Answer:[36m
- DataRetrieval: Its description focuses on result saving and plotting, not on retrieving data.
- ModelTraining (within MLTrainingAndEvaluation): Described with a focus on regression, not binary classification.
- ModelEvaluation (within MLTrainingAndEvaluation): Also described with a focus on regression metrics, not binary classification.
- ModelTraining (within MLModelValidation): Described with a focus on regression, not binary classification.
- ModelEvaluation (within MLModelValidation): Described with a focus on regression metrics, not binary classification.[0m
