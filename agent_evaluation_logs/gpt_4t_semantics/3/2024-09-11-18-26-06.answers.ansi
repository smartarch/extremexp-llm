- DataRetrieval: Its description suggests activities unrelated to data retrieval, which is misleading.
- ModelTraining (MLTrainingAndEvaluation): Described as training a regression model, which is incorrect for a binary classification task.
- ModelTraining (MLModelValidation): Shares the same issue as above, incorrectly mentioning regression training.
